### Course Description
From intelligent chat-bots and video-sharing apps to social media platforms and virtual reality hubs, our world is infused with mediated, networked systems for communication. While these tools were a luxury a couple years ago, today they are almost a necessity. Everyday we are knowingly or unknowingly using a handful of connected applications to communicate with people across the world. With this course we want students to be more than participants in these tools, but also become active creators. In this course, students will design and develop their own creative connected web applications. By coding (using javascript) and producing original online experiences that bring people together in playful yet purposeful ways, students will gain valuable insight into the inner-workings and implications of our connected world. The course will culminate in students creating their own connected applications that can be used by peers.
 
### Learning Objectives
1. Develop a basic understanding of web design and development that includes both client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end) tools and technologies (PLO - 5 )
1. Gain comfort working with the Javascript language as well as the ecosystem of open source Javascript libraries (PLO - 5 )
1. Develop an understanding of how to manage and work with data (i.e. objects) to produce engaging interactions and compelling narratives (PLO - 2, 3 )	
1. Learn about web-based networking technologies and how to leverage real-time communication channels towards creative participatory experiences  (PLO - 1, 3 )
1. Learn how to create prototypes for user-testing and how to build a project end-to-end  (PLO - 3,7)
1. Gain experience collaborating with others in both creative and technical project work  (PLO - 6,7,8 )

### Structure & Teaching Methodology
This is a production-based course that involves programming work both inside and outside of the classroom. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to write code, ask questions, and engage in both creative and technical discussion. During class, code examples will be presented, written, and reviewed. Examples and assignments will iteratively build upon lessons learned in preceding classes. 

The course embraces an active-learning approach believing that programming, design, and web development are best understood by doing. Thus, much of the live class time will be spent collectively working through code examples and project-making activities. Time will also be allotted for students to share ideas, explore collaborative opportunities, present work, offer feedback, conduct user-testing, and review code.

### Project Briefs
**Project 1 - Due Week 5**
Create a web application that utilizes both a data set and the p5.js library. The data you incorporate can be static or dynamic, and it should be “represented” in some way in a p5 sketch embedded on your web page.  Your web page should include at least a .html file, a .css file and a .js file. At least one user interaction is required. The interaction could be a user providing input to make a specific data request, a user affecting the contents of a p5 sketch, or a user doing something else. It’s up to you but the user should be able to do something! And you are welcome to have multiple “interactions”, but you need at least one.

Here are some examples to help you think through possible project ideas. Note, these examples are not exact representations of what you are being asked to do. Rather, they are offered here as inspiration for the direction or type of work you might consider doing.

* [Paper Signals with Google](https://papersignals.withgoogle.com/)
* [How Many People Are In Space Now](https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/)

**Project 2 - Due Week 10**
Create a web application that allows a user to send and receive  data. Your project should incorporate NodeJS, Express and either NeDB for storage, Socket.io for real-time multi-person data exchange or both NeDB & Socket.io. The aim is to produce an experience where users can interact, either alone or with one another, and submit data that is stored (NeDB) and/or exchanged (Socket.io) and represented to other users either in real-time or on a static page. Examples include:
* A single or multi-person game where there is a high score page
* A collaborative creative tool with a gallery page
* A personal/communal message board

* [p5 Play Library](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/)
* [PaperPlanes.world (mobile experience)](https://paperplanes.world/)

**Final Project - Due Week 14**
Create a web application that has both client-side and server side code. You are welcome to continue working on Project #2, return to Project #1, or start an entirely new project. Similar to Project #2, users who engage with your application site must have some ability to “connect” with other users. This could be done by collecting  user data, storing it in a database, and sharing it back with other users. Or this could be done by incorporating real-time connections and communication via Sockets or WebRTC. You are welcome to use any client-side javascript library you like, but you should use at least one.

### Course Schedule
The course will be divided into 3 modules:

* Module 1 (Weeks 1 - 5) - Talking to the Web: In this module, we will cover the fundamentals of client-side web development and we will explore how to use data from the web to produce creative stories and user interactions.
* Module 2 (Weeks 6 - 10) - Talking to Each Other: In this module, we will cover the fundamentals of server-side web development with a focus on technologies that allow for real-time multi-person communication and participatory experiences.
* Module 3 (Weeks 11 - 14) - Talking++ (Stop Talking, Start Listening): In this module, we will focus on project building, play-testing, and user experience all directed towards a final project. We will also provide multiple curricular branches and directions to choose from that will allow you to explore how to interface with additional libraries, media and tools.

Weekly Schedule

Every week will be broken down into 2 classes. 1 theory class that is of length 1 hour 15 minutes, and 1 lab class that is of length 2 hours and 40 minutes (including a 10 minute break). During the theory class we will also do weekly homework reviews and project critiques.

### Attendance
You are expected to attend your assigned section each week. For your section, we ask that you join on time and stay the entire time. It can be disruptive to join late and/or leave early. If you know you might be late or have to leave early, please reach out to your instructor as early as possible. Also, if you know you will not be able to attend a section, please reach out to your instructor as soon as possible to let them know. Incomplete attendance will adversely affect your ability to succeed in the class. 

You will be required to present your projects in class on the days the projects are due. Project presentation weeks  are as follows:

Mid-Term Project 1 -  Week 5 - Feb 24th
Mid-Term Project 2 - Week 10 - April 7th
FInal Project - Week 14 - May 12th

### Participation
* Sustained participation that demonstrates thoughtful engagement with the course materials is a requirement to succeed in this class. 
* Active participation helps us, your instructors, get to know you as individuals and keep track of your progress. It also provides both you and your classmates greater opportunities to learn from one another. 
* Ways to Participate During Class
    * Be present, attentive, and mindful.
    * Contribute to class discussions by raising questions, supporting/challenging points of interest, offering feedback to other student’s ideas, making connections to examples and material across the program, and sharing relevant personal experiences and perspectives.
    * Share assignment work. This includes a working website, a website that kind of works but not the way you expected, a website that did work but doesn’t anymore, and so on. Basically, don’t be afraid to volunteer to show what you did or tried to do even if it is not “perfect”.  Explaining your work to other people is one of the best ways to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself. Plus, showing work that falls short of your goals is not a sign of failure, it is an opportunity to learn and grow.
    * Provide constructive feedback to other student’s project work and presentations.
* Ways to Participate Outside of Class
    * Volunteer to be a user-tester for other student’s project
    * Provide constructive feedback to other student’s project work and presentations
    * Thoroughly document your work so that other students can understand your intentions, process and insights.
    * Be open to working in a group on a project
    * Be an active contributor in a group project
* If you have any concerns pertaining to the course expectations around participation, please do your best to communicate with the instructors, a staff member or a University administrator. And if you would like extra help or require additional instruction, please let your instructor know.

### Weekly Assignments
Each week, you will be expected to complete and upload an assignment by the beginning of the first class each week. Specific instructions on how best to upload and/or submit the week’s assignment will be shared in the weekly homework schedule.

Assignments may include completing a code exercise, creating a web prototype, or furthering the progress of a larger project. Weekly assignments will assume you have watched the assigned course videos and reviewed any other homework material, i.e. readings, supplementary videos, examples, etc prior to doing the assignment.

A large chunk of class time during theory class will often be spent reviewing the weekly assignments and/or actively building upon them, so it is imperative that you do the work and come prepared to share and discuss. Please feel free to create study groups and work alongside your classmates on any of these assignments. However, you must submit your own individual assignment work.
