* Go over application critique 
* Here are a few themes I saw appearing again and again
  * low barrier to entry - is it easy to get started? Is the intent clear? How is the UX and UI
  * clear use case - does the audience know their role in the applications 
  * work within digital limitations - how can we provide a "real" experience
  * ease of sharing

* Go over webpage Homework

* What are we doing this week? - let's look at some examples

* The DOM and javascript!
* What is the DOM
  *  Document Object Model - [MDN on DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
  *  It is the data representation of the structure of a document on the web
  *  It is useful as it helps us interact with and manipulate the web using javascript
  *  Let's look at how we can access it from the browser

* But for that, first we need to use javascript!
  * Javascript - language of the web
  * Used for interactions
  * Those of you who have done p5 - p5 is nothing but a js library
  * A few things about js to note
    * it is a scripting language (unlike HTML and CSS)
    * js is a loosely typed language
    * it can be used for front and back end
    * Until recently it could only be run on the web, but now it can be run standalone
    * It is an interpreted language
