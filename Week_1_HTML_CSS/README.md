  * It works with the `display` property in css. It can values such as `block`, `none`, `flex` etc. We will be using `flex` quite a bit.
  * Once within flex, the 2 main properties we will look at are `justify-content`, and `align-items`. To practice flexbox, try out [Felxbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

* Look at the Developer Tools (Go over the DOM time permitting)

  * Here, you can look at the HTML under "Elements"
  * Errors and messages can be found under "Console"
  * The console can also be used to write and tst javascript code (more on this in the next class)

**Assignments**
* READ The Elements of User Design Chapter 6 - [The Skeleton Plane](https://learning-oreilly-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/library/view/the-elements-of/9780321684486/ch07.html#ch06lev1sec1)

* MAKE a simple wireframe of one of your present/past projects.
* MAKE a webpage version  of  the wireframe you have designed. Your assignment should include a .html file and a .css file. You could do this in a number of ways. For example, if your slide has a colored background, you could either implement the same background through CSS or you could upload an image and set that as the background for your web page. 
* DOCUMENT  your progress and learnings from the making of the webpage
