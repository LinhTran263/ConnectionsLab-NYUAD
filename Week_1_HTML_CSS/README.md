* Flexbox - 
  * The flex layout allows to create flexible elements on a webpage
  * It works with the `display` property in css. It can values such as `block`, `none`, `flex` etc. We will be using `flex` quite a bit.
  * Once within flex, the 2 main properties we will look at are `justify-content`, and `align-items`. To practice flexbox, try out [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

* Look at the Developer Tools (Go over the DOM time permitting)
  * You can open the developer tools on Chrome using the shortcut: Command + Option + J (Mac) or Control + Shift + J (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS)
  * Here, you can look at the HTML under "Elements"
  * Errors and messages can be found under "Console"
  * The console can also be used to write and tst javascript code (more on this in the next class)
